WSJ_0034.MRG-25   What *ICH*-1 *T*-41 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios .
WSJ_0037.MRG-25   `` You Gotta Have Wa '' is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers , rationed * to two per team , fare *T*-1 in Japan .
WSJ_0037.MRG-29   In sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages , Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers ' lives -- at the regimented office , where employees are assigned *-59 lunch partners *T*-1 -- and at `` home '' in the austere company dormitory run * by a prying caretaker *T*-2 .
WSJ_0039.MRG-3   But it is Mr. Lane , as movie director , producer and writer , who *T*-65 has been obsessed with * refitting Chaplin 's Little Tramp in a contemporary way .
WSJ_0039.MRG-9   Composer Marc Marder , a college friend of Mr. Lane 's who *T*-66 earns his living *-1 playing the double bass in classical music ensembles , has prepared an exciting , eclectic score that *T*-67 tells you what the characters are thinking *T*-2 and feeling *T*-2 far more precisely than intertitles , or even words , would *?* .

WSJ_0044.MRG-129   `` We work damn hard at what we do *T*-101 for damn little pay , and what she did *T*-1 cast unfair aspersions on all of us . ''
WSJ_0044.MRG-132   There may be others doing what she did *T*-1 . ''

WSJ_0062.MRG-5   The magazine combines how-to pieces on topics like backyard composting , explanatory essays on such things as what *T*-1 happens after you flush your toilet , and hard-hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders .
WSJ_0067.MRG-6   We have , and I 'm sure 0 others have *?* , considered what our options are *T*-160 , and we 've had conversations with people who in the future *T*-1 might prove *-2 to be interesting partners . ''

WSJ_0071.MRG-28   `` What *T*-164 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out .

WSJ_0077.MRG-9   But with the end of the year in sight , money managers are eager *-1 to take profits and cut their risks of *-2 losing what for many *T*-178 have been exceptionally good returns in
WSJ_0080.MRG-21   It *EXP*-1 was n't clear how NL and Mr. Simmons would respond *T*-2 if Georgia Gulf spurns them again .
WSJ_0080.MRG-22   Mr. Martin said 0 they have n't yet decided what their next move would be *T*-181 , but he did n't rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed * at * replacing Georgia Gulf 's board .
WSJ_0082.MRG-4   Where they disagree *T*-1 is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan .
WSJ_0082.MRG-5   The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives *T*-183 as barriers to investment ; Japan denies 0 there are real barriers .
WSJ_0082.MRG-27   But they have n't clarified what those might be *T*-187 .
WSJ_0082.MRG-31   `` We need *-1 to clarify what exactly *T*-188 is wrong with it . ''
WSJ_0085.MRG-32   Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay *T*-201 for deposits , as well as opened up the field for new products such as high-rate CDs .
WSJ_0088.MRG-24   At one point , Mr. Phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman , Rep. Edward Markey -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , by *-2 not going much beyond what *T*-1 already had been reported *-131 in the morning newspapers .
WSJ_0088.MRG-27   At another point during the hearing , Rep. Markey asked Mr. Phelan what *T*-1 would be discussed *-133 at a New York exchange board meeting today .
WSJ_0089.MRG-55   Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need *-1 to be rung *-140 *T*-2 -- like in small , rural parishes and inner-city churches .
WSJ_0090.MRG-48   In any case , opinion *ICH*-2 is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get *T*-1 even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels .
WSJ_0093.MRG-6   The paper accused him of *-3 being a leading proponent of `` peaceful evolution , '' a catch phrase 0 * to describe what China believes 0 *T*-1 is the policy *ICH*-4 of Western countries * to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere *T*-2 .
WSJ_0093.MRG-15   Despite the harsh exchanges , the U.S. and China still seem *-1 to be looking for a way 0 * to mend relations , which *T*-244 have deteriorated into what Mr. Nixon referred to *T*-2 as `` the greatest crisis in Chinese-American relations '' since his initial visit to China 17 years ago *T*-3 .
WSJ_0096.MRG-40   Mr. Felten said , `` We got what *T*-252 amounted to a parking ticket , and by *-1 complaining about it , we ended up with a sizable fine and suspension . ''
WSJ_0097.MRG-14   Japan 's Finance Ministry had set up mechanisms 0 *-1 to limit how far futures prices could fall *T*-2 in a single session and *-1 to give market operators the authority * to suspend trading in futures at any time .
WSJ_0100.MRG-35   Mr. Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of * concentrating on what a company knows *T*-1 best .
WSJ_0102.MRG-3   But there 's disagreement over how * to do it *T*-1 .
WSJ_0107.MRG-3   The Bush administration has threatened *-1 to veto such a bill because of what it views *T*-2 as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry , but the 300-113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential 0 * to override a veto *T*-3 .
WSJ_0108.MRG-2   You now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting *T*-1 to those 130 million people around the world who *T*-20 tune in to it each week .
WSJ_0108.MRG-3   You can even take notes -- extensive notes , for the Voice folks wo n't look over your shoulder -- about what you read *T*-1 .
WSJ_0108.MRG-8   And I apparently had no right * to print hither what the Voice was booming *T*-2 to yon .
WSJ_0112.MRG-35   What *T*-1 becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult 0 for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo *T*-2 .
WSJ_0112.MRG-52   Moreover , the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice *T*-1 .
WSJ_0113.MRG-6   What *T*-42 saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity * to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had `` mortgaged '' *T*-1 to the government under price-support loan programs .
WSJ_0114.MRG-8   An attempted buy-out led * by John J. McCabe , chief operating officer , never materialized , and a stream of what one staff member dismissed *T*-1 as `` tire-kickers and lookee-loos '' had filed through since .
WSJ_0118.MRG-6   The real battle is over who *T*-1 will control that market and reap its huge rewards .
WSJ_0118.MRG-30   `` I do not want my money invested *-2 in what I consider *T*-3 as nothing more than a casino , '' Mr. Bradley wrote *T*-1 .
WSJ_0118.MRG-48   That divergence is what stock index traders seek *T*-69 .
WSJ_0118.MRG-49   When it occurs *T*-1 , the traders place orders *ICH*-2 via computers * to buy the basket of stocks -LRB- such as the 500 stocks that *T*-3 constitute the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index -RRB- in whichever market *T*-4 is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market ; they lock in the difference in price as profit .
WSJ_0118.MRG-53   The speed with which such program trades take place *T*-1 and the volatile price movements 0 they can cause *T*-2 are what program trading critics profess *-3 to despise *T*-4 .
WSJ_0118.MRG-117   But in 1986 , program traders received what *T*-73 amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations , * to make it *EXP*-1 easier * to link the stock and futures markets .
WSJ_0118.MRG-131   That represents a very thin `` excess '' return , certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim *-1 to seek *T*-2 as their performance objective .
WSJ_0118.MRG-142   * Think about what *T*-1 causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago .
WSJ_0118.MRG-157   The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive , and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term .
WSJ_0118.MRG-163   Some of the proposed fixes for what *T*-1 is labeled *-80 `` program-trading volatility '' could be far worse than the perceived problem .
WSJ_0118.MRG-171   They continually advise their clients on which individual stocks * to buy or sell *T*-1 , while their clients continue *-2 to hope for superior performance .
WSJ_0126.MRG-26   But to Moon Landrieu , the former New Orleans mayor who *T*-1 helped *-3 build that city 's cavernous , money-losing Superdome , questions of who *T*-2 benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance .
WSJ_0126.MRG-28   `` It is the very building of it *ICH*-4 that *T*-2 is important , not how much of it *T*-3 is used *-1 or its economics . ''
WSJ_0126.MRG-31   Today taxpayers get *-1 to vote , most of the time , on whether they want *-2 to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs , or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions .
WSJ_0128.MRG-12   What *T*-1 worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings .
WSJ_0130.MRG-3   But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum 0 this country has *T*-2 0 * to debate risk , technology and innovation *T*-3 *T*-1 .
WSJ_0130.MRG-20   The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction *-1 to make it *EXP*-2 much harder * to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs *T*-3 .
WSJ_0130.MRG-24   This raises the key issue : What * to do *T*-2 about people who *T*-1 suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs ?
WSJ_0142.MRG-28   Some dealers said 0 the Treasury 's intent is * to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities , * given uncertainties about when the auction will occur *T*-1 .
WSJ_0156.MRG-3   But Equitable said 0 it was unable *-1 to find a buyer willing * to pay what it considers *T*-2 `` fair value '' for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing .
WSJ_0192.MRG-60   Also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted 0 *T*-4 , was *T*-3 a report by Chicago purchasing agents , which *T*-1 precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that *T*-2 is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold *T*-5 .
WSJ_0203.MRG-15   What the investors who *T*-4 oppose the proposed changes object to *T*-1 most is the effect 0 they say 0 the proposal would have *T*-2 on their ability * to spot telltale `` clusters '' of trading activity -- buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time .
WSJ_0203.MRG-24   But Mr. Lane said that while the SEC regulates who *T*-7 files , the law tells them when * to do so *T*-1 .
WSJ_0207.MRG-8   He believes in what he plays *T*-16 , and he plays superbly .
WSJ_0207.MRG-20   The end of the first half , however , brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed *-2 to be waiting for *T*-1 : the pop singer Judy Collins , who *T*-20 appears on `` Inner Voices . ''
WSJ_0210.MRG-5   What *T*-42 triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue .
WSJ_0210.MRG-15   `` It may very well be what the Japanese banks want *T*-43 , '' he told Radio New Zealand *T*-1 .
WSJ_0214.MRG-61   At the weatherbeaten Pompano Beach municipal stadium , Mr. Blair , the 45-year-old former Oriole , knows 0 his power is n't what it used *-2 to be *T*-1 .
WSJ_0239.MRG-21   What they wo n't tell you *T*-1 is * not to go aloft in anything 0 you do n't want *-3 to get *T*-2 wet .
WSJ_0242.MRG-7   Allies concerned about the deadline include the British , French and smaller NATO allies , some of whom *T*-107 do n't have adequate staffs 0 *T*-1 to provide quick answers to the questions being raised * by what *T*-2 generally are considered *-72 the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted * .
WSJ_0246.MRG-2   The increase follows the company 's report of strong earnings for the third quarter , and reflects what American Brands called *T*-113 its `` tradition of * sharing earnings growth '' with shareholders .
WSJ_0250.MRG-4   The compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the White House had said 0 it would accept *T*-1 .
WSJ_0257.MRG-6   He also is an entertaining writer , *-2 combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work *T*-1 .
WSJ_0259.MRG-1   Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how * to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without *-2 adding to the federal budget deficit *T*-1 .
WSJ_0261.MRG-12   `` We make what we know how * to make *T*-1 *T*-2 , '' says *T*-3 business manager Richard Mazzera .
WSJ_0268.MRG-3   I await his sequel : the economic and social resiliency of the San Francisco Bay area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as metaphors for the supremacy of whatever failed system Mr. Cockburn now believes in *T*-1 .
WSJ_0294.MRG-6   Bankruptcy experts said 0 the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company 's case *T*-1 .
WSJ_0295.MRG-13   As a consultant , he has given seminars *ICH*-1 at agencies including Ogilvy & Mather on how * to win new business *T*-2 .
WSJ_0295.MRG-33   It struck me as a way 0 * to get back to what I really want *-3 to do *T*-2 *T*-1 . ''
WSJ_0296.MRG-33   On U.S. military presence in Asia : *-3 Asked *-4 if his offer * to allow the American military to use facilities in Singapore would help preserve America 's presence in the region at bases in the Philippines , he said , `` What we have done *T*-302 is * make it *EXP*-1 easier for the Philippines to continue *-5 to host American bases without it being said 0 they are lackeys of the imperialists and the only ones in Asia or in Southeast Asia .
WSJ_0296.MRG-56   On Cambodia : `` * Let 's assume that -LCB- former Cambodian leader Prince Norodom -RCB- Sihanouk does what the press wants him to do *T*-1 and joins up with -LCB- Vietnamese-backed Cambodian leader -RCB- Hun Sen .
WSJ_0300.MRG-9   Conservative Japanese investors are put off *-1 by what they consider *T*-2 Mexico 's restrictive investment regulations and loose work habits .
WSJ_0300.MRG-44   But Mr. Ruffo frets that an even bigger problem could be protectionism from the U.S. , where some politicians oppose what they consider *T*-2 Japanese efforts * to use maquiladoras *-3 to crack the U.S. market through the back door *T*-1 .
WSJ_0305.MRG-49   The key to Pinkerton 's future will be * sticking to what it does *T*-1 best -- * being a security company , says 0 *T*-2 Mr. Wathen .
WSJ_0309.MRG-9   But the higher mortgage ceiling is only the starter kit for what Senator Alan Cranston and Majority Leader George Mitchell have *T*-1 in mind for housing .
WSJ_0314.MRG-8   `` I ca n't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is *T*-1 *T*-3 , '' says *T*-2 Mr. Seidman , who *T*-36 heads the AFL-CIO 's department dealing with health matters .
WSJ_0314.MRG-44   This involves trade-offs and -LCB- it -RCB- cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what *T*-1 is ` necessary . ' ''
WSJ_0317.MRG-9   Takeover stock traders noted that with the junk-bond market in disarray , Georgia-Pacific 's bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed *T*-1 : namely , industrial companies can continue *-2 bidding for one another , but financial buyers such as leveraged buy-out firms will be at a disadvantage in * obtaining financing .
WSJ_0326.MRG-14   But some anti-smoking activists disagree , *-1 expressing anger at what they see *T*-64 as the company 's attempt * to purchase innocence by association .
WSJ_0327.MRG-39   `` The interest-rate sensitives are n't rallying with the rest of the market because of fears about what the -LRB- Federal Reserve -RRB- will do , '' Mr. Jennison said *T*-1 .
WSJ_0331.MRG-8   But value , it turns out 0 *T*-1 , is only what a buyer will pay *T*-82 .
WSJ_0349.MRG-11   What the Big Board is considering *T*-1 is re-establishing a `` collar '' on program trading when the market moves significantly *T*-2 .
WSJ_0349.MRG-42   Despite what some investors are suggesting *T*-2 , the Big Board is n't even considering a total ban on program trading or stock futures , exchange officials said 0 *T*-1 .
WSJ_0349.MRG-48   What I 'm trying *-1 to say to people is , 0 it *EXP*-2 's proper * to worry about program trading , but it 's only a piece of the business . ''
WSJ_0358.MRG-4   In late May , Newmark & Lewis announced a plan * to cut prices 5 % to 20 % and eliminate what it called *T*-166 a `` standard discount-retailing practice '' of * negotiating individual deals with customers .
WSJ_0361.MRG-9   He did n't say what the company expected *-1 to report *T*-2 for year-earlier sales , which *T*-178 will be restated *-3 from the previously reported $ 603 million *U* .
WSJ_0367.MRG-17   `` What I hope *-1 to bring *T*-2 to this is another word : process .

WSJ_0415.MRG-4   `` I feel sorry for whoever *T*-1 wins , '' says *T*-2 a Brazilian diplomat .
WSJ_0415.MRG-5   Who that winner will be *T*-1 is highly uncertain .
WSJ_0415.MRG-7   `` Whoever *T*-1 says 0 he knows which of the six *T*-2 will win is out of his mind , '' says *T*-3 Antonio Britto , a centrist member of Parliament .
WSJ_0415.MRG-19   What *T*-1 comes out of the ballot box could be crucial in * determining whether Brazil finally lives up to the potential of the world 's eighth largest economy or keeps *-2 living up to its other , less enviable title : that of the developing world 's largest debtor , teetering on the brink of hyperinflation , mired in deficits and stagnation , with huge economic inequalities and social discontent boiling under the surface .
WSJ_0415.MRG-22   `` And where we are *T*-1 is bad . ''
WSJ_0415.MRG-40   But despite the differences in what they say *T*-1 , according to some analysts here , economic constraints mean 0 the next president may not have many choices about what he does *T*-2 .
WSJ_0416.MRG-18   Now there 's a new wrinkle *ICH*-2 in what young doctors want *T*-1 : More than half of 300 residents responding to recent survey said 0 they 'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee-for-service compensation in their first professional position .
WSJ_0417.MRG-2   The offer came just prior to arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court over whether the Free Press should be allowed *-1 to enter into a joint operating pact with Gannett Co. 's Detroit News .

WSJ_0466.MRG-14   A company official says 0 Michael 's break-even volume on Easy Eggs is around 60 million pounds a year -- apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested 0 *T*-1 was a billion-pound market waiting for such a product .

WSJ_0473.MRG-2   The application by Foothills , owned * by Calgary-based Nova Corp. of Alberta and Westcoast Energy Inc. of Vancouver , Canada , is expected *-2 to kick off what *T*-1 could be a contentious battle for the right * to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from still-undeveloped fields in Canada 's Mackenzie River delta .

WSJ_1372.MRG-21   They were what he called *T*-2 an `` unlawful termination '' by MGM/UA of the acquisition agreement with Qintex , high Australian interest rates , a pilots ' strike at Australian domestic airlines that *T*-1 cut revenue at the company 's Australian resorts and delays in * completing a sale of two regional TV stations in Queensland state .
WSJ_1375.MRG-17   `` What I thought 0 I was saying *T*-2 is that the market is troubled but still viable and , appropriately enough , quite quality-conscious , which *T*-1 is not at all bad , '' he says *T*-3 .
WSJ_1375.MRG-19   What *T*-2 has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold *-1 with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds .
WSJ_1386.MRG-11   Otherwise , they 'd be watching programs that *T*-1 are no different in quality from what they currently view *T*-2 on color TVs .
WSJ_1388.MRG-34   `` He did n't say much , but what he said *T*-1 was important because it 's not in the score .
WSJ_1394.MRG-16   What managers really fear *T*-1 is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots .
WSJ_1394.MRG-66   Although *-2 encouraging dialogue between managers and workers , Mr. Smith does n't countenance what he considers *T*-1 insubordination .
WSJ_1397.MRG-20   What *T*-2 makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism -- earned * , we discover , when he was assigned *-1 to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s *T*-3 .
WSJ_1397.MRG-48   You 're the real criminal here ... and what you did *T*-1 was n't just a murder -- it was a crime against humanity . ''
WSJ_1405.MRG-4   He was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan 's second term *T*-1 .
WSJ_1405.MRG-5   So , *-3 following both the style 0 he pursued *T*-2 as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried *-3 to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , * gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in * distilling that information for the president and then making sure 0 presidential decisions are carried *-1 out .
WSJ_1405.MRG-13   The National Security Council itself was established *-1 in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the White House 0 *T*-2 to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence agencies .
WSJ_1409.MRG-2   Matthew Lesko , something of a professional defender of government , thought 0 he had a sure-fire winner last summer when he offered $ 5,000 *U* for the best `` verifiable story of 250 words or less about how a government bureaucrat helped you *T*-2 *T*-1 . ''
WSJ_1409.MRG-16   But Mr. Lesko 's staff is beginning *-1 to wonder whether there is n't some larger phenomenon foiling the contest .
WSJ_1409.MRG-22   If he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat mishandled something *T*-1 , Mr. Lesko admits 0 *T*-2 , `` I 'd get 5,000 entries . ''
WSJ_1411.MRG-34   He likes *-1 to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive ranch during an early visit , took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help *T*-2 .
WSJ_1411.MRG-104   Besides , to a large extent , Mr. Jones may already be getting what he wants *T*-1 out of the team , even though it keeps losing .
WSJ_1412.MRG-9   But his complaint that `` Days of Rage '' does n't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving *T*-1 is irrelevant .
WSJ_1412.MRG-11   This film did emphasize how long the Israeli/Palestinian stalemate has existed *T*-3 by *-7 tracing the conflict to the days of World War I when the British tried *-4 to guarantee both a Jewish state and a Palestinian state without *-6 specifying how it was * to be done *-1 *T*-5 *T*-2 .
WSJ_1413.MRG-9   Last week , Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $ 16.1 billion *U* spending reduction , half of which *T*-1 must come from defense , *-2 to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by * applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget .
WSJ_1416.MRG-7   Those `` people '' to whom I refer *T*-1 are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom *T*-2 share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled * out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc .
WSJ_1418.MRG-23   There are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what *T*-1 could become a financial crisis .
WSJ_1422.MRG-11   Once * activated *-3 , the card would sit in the car 's window , *-2 showing traffic wardens how much time the motorist could remain *T*-1 .
WSJ_1423.MRG-6   Last year , a federal appeals court in St. Louis said 0 the preamble was unconstitutional , *-1 citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling that states ca n't justify stricter abortion curbs by * changing the definition of when life begins *T*-2 .
WSJ_1423.MRG-8   The high court majority said 0 it *EXP*-1 was up to the state courts for now * to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws .
WSJ_1424.MRG-10   What *T*-1 gives these events particular significance , however , is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the horn of Africa .
WSJ_1424.MRG-30   What this all means *T*-1 in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in Ethiopia is collapsing as fast as President Barre 's regime in Somalia is *?* .
WSJ_1424.MRG-37   Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway *T*-1 , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the Bush administration to blast the regime publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential Somalis * to understand .
WSJ_1424.MRG-41   But as one expert tells me : `` Whoever it is *T*-1 will have *-2 to work pretty damn hard *-3 to be worse than Barre . ''
WSJ_1424.MRG-44   * Remember that it took Mr. Mengistu many months , in what *T*-1 became known as the `` creeping coup , '' * to topple Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and 1975 .
WSJ_1424.MRG-46   But the U.S. has one great advantage : The Soviets are universally loathed *-1 throughout Ethiopia for what they did *T*-2 to the country this past decade -- famine and all .
WSJ_1429.MRG-13   The Rafale project is the result of France 's inability jointly * to develop a plane with other countries , and French officials question whether the state can continue *-1 paying for expensive independent programs .
WSJ_1429.MRG-15   What *T*-1 brought the naval issue to a head is that the Crusaders are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan * to replace them .
WSJ_1435.MRG-2   Some scenes : -- Saturday morning , a resident was given *-1 15 minutes * to scurry into a sagging building and reclaim what she could *T*-2 of her life 's possessions .
WSJ_1435.MRG-21   `` It *EXP*-3 's so weird * to have * to decide what *T*-1 's really important to you , '' said *T*-2 Barbara May .
WSJ_1436.MRG-21   What *T*-1 had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock , thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that Vermont-Slauson yields *T*-2 . ''
WSJ_1436.MRG-48   Government officials who *T*-1 wonder how important it *EXP*-4 is *T*-2 for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit Vermont-Slauson and Grand Boulevard Plaza and decide for themselves .
WSJ_1440.MRG-24   As a result , Morgan Stanley 's Index of 40 Emerging Growth Stocks -- most of which *T*-1 are in the OTC market -- is up only 13 % for the year , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has leaped 24 % and the S&P 500 has grown 25 % .
WSJ_1442.MRG-9   Pinnacle West Capital Corp. , which *T*-1 has been wrangling with regulators for months over what * to do *T*-2 about Pinnacle 's moribund Merabank thrift unit , suspended its dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income .
WSJ_1445.MRG-21   Yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which *T*-3 are aimed *-1 at a hot new class of computers called * notebooks .
WSJ_1446.MRG-13   In an effort * to determine whether a caller has reason 0 * to sue *T*-2 , Cane lawyers review documents and perform research , if necessary , with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers .
WSJ_1446.MRG-23   The jury found them guilty of conspiracy in * obtaining the payments , some of which *T*-3 were disguised *-1 as fees for consulting services from Mrs. Garcia .
WSJ_1446.MRG-28   Mr. Garcia , who *T*-1 represents New York 's 18th congressional district , which *T*-2 includes the Bronx , said 0 he has n't decided whether he will resign .
WSJ_1453.MRG-10   But the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what *T*-1 can happen when the going gets rough *T*-2 .
WSJ_1453.MRG-11   `` You want *-1 to know how a fund did when the market got hammered *T*-3 *T*-2 , '' said *T*-4 Kurt Brouwer , an investment adviser with Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco .
WSJ_1453.MRG-13   What you want *-2 to know *T*-1 is when the road 's rough *T*-3 , when there 's snow and ice *T*-4 , how 's this car going *-5 to perform *T*-6 ? ''
WSJ_1453.MRG-43   From its high point on Thursday , Oct. 12 , to where it traded late in New York a week later *T*-1 , the dollar fell 3.6 % against the West German mark , 3.4 % against the British pound and 2.1 % against the Japanese yen .
WSJ_1453.MRG-51   *-2 Noting that equity funds are up nearly 60 % from their post-crash low on Dec. 3 , 1987 , he said that what *T*-1 happened last week `` may not be enough of an adjustment .
WSJ_1455.MRG-11   What *T*-1 really stirs his muse , though , is aerobic architecture .
WSJ_1455.MRG-66   Mr. Muniak 's company , Balag Ltd. , has agreed *-2 to set aside the money 0 * to plant and maintain it *T*-3 , but discussions are still going on over where * to place it *T*-4 and how * to ensure that it will be maintained *-1 *T*-5 .
WSJ_1457.MRG-48   Paper work on how it was spent *-1 *T*-2 is incomplete .
WSJ_1457.MRG-62   `` He simply has n't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $ 58,000 *U* two years later *T*-1 , '' says *T*-2 Mr. Powers , the Giuliani campaign manager .
WSJ_1457.MRG-64   So far though , no one -- not even former U.S. attorney Giuliani -- has been able *-3 to pinpoint just what law Mr. Dinkins has broken *T*-1 or just what tax he has evaded *T*-2 .
WSJ_1460.MRG-2   The investigation , which *T*-2 will be coordinated *-1 with one already under way in the U.S. , follows the discovery of what Ferranti has called *T*-3 a `` serious '' fraud involving its U.S. subsidiary .
WSJ_1470.MRG-26   Partners lecture on how * to form corporations , draft agreements and defend clients against unwanted tender offers *T*-1 .
WSJ_1474.MRG-18   The Bush administration , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in HDTV should be *T*-1 , is n't doing much for now .
WSJ_1474.MRG-20   The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what Japan and other prospective competitors are spending *T*-1 .
WSJ_1480.MRG-35   `` What they are telling you *T*-1 is that they do n't have the ability * to generate higher returns internally , '' says *T*-2 Mr. Sloan .
WSJ_1490.MRG-21   That way , they figure 0 *T*-1 , someone else has an even stronger motivation 0 * to make sure 0 the deal is going *-3 to work *T*-2 , because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs .
WSJ_1495.MRG-6   They were disturbed *-1 at what they regarded *T*-4 as Dr. Baltimore 's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee , which *T*-2 held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who *T*-3 had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore .
WSJ_1497.MRG-4   Whether Mr. McInnes 's oversight is merely a sign of a mainlander 's benign neglect is a question 0 my fellow Channel Islanders -LRB- and friends on the Isle of Man -RRB- will continue *-2 to ponder *T*-1 .
WSJ_1499.MRG-45   What *T*-1 is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that well-intentioned public programs often backfire .
WSJ_1504.MRG-17   These firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world : the rise of what I call *T*-1 corporate due process .
WSJ_1505.MRG-34   London was weak throughout Friday 's trading , however , on what dealers attributed *T*-1 to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week 's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September .
WSJ_1506.MRG-21   The guideline was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations .
WSJ_1506.MRG-22   In fact , yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what *T*-1 had been agreed to *-2 .
WSJ_1512.MRG-18   Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Group , Providence , R.I. , expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % , well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % , partly because of what he believes 0 *T*-1 will be temporarily better price behavior .
WSJ_1515.MRG-7   If the whole market thinks 0 what you 're doing *T*-1 is crazy you do n't have much competition . ''
WSJ_1515.MRG-32   `` But we certainly like what we 've seen *T*-1 so far . ''
WSJ_1515.MRG-38   Analysts say 0 its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages *-2 to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture *T*-1 .
WSJ_1525.MRG-26   Ramon Garcia , the Asset Trust 's executive trustee , admits to what he calls *T*-1 `` temporary setbacks . ''
WSJ_1529.MRG-7   -LRB- True , the Mexican government has granted `` control '' over the airline to a new private consortium , but its propensity * to take back what it gives *T*-1 is too well known *-2 * to permit one to be sanguine . -RRB-
WSJ_1529.MRG-16   A long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to *T*-1 , without *-2 having *-3 to answer to the public .
WSJ_1547.MRG-29   The U.S. and Israel have been holding what an aide to Prime Minister Shamir called *T*-1 intense telephone negotiations in an effort * to bridge differences over Mideast peace moves .
WSJ_1549.MRG-4   `` With Krenz , we just do n't know what * to expect *T*-1 . ''
WSJ_1549.MRG-45   `` Either way , I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed *T*-1 . ''
WSJ_1550.MRG-49   At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California , new experiments indicated that the lithium added * to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted *T*-1 , reported 0 *T*-2 Philip Ross from the California laboratory .
WSJ_1560.MRG-14   `` Who *T*-1 knows how much they 'll be worth *T*-2 100 years from now ? ''
WSJ_1560.MRG-17   Why Mr. Jackson , who *T*-3 could n't be reached *-1 for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale *T*-2 is n't clear .
WSJ_1562.MRG-4   There are all sorts of ways 0 * to give buy and sell instructions to a broker *T*-1 -- and just as many ways 0 * to get burned *-2 if you do n't know what you 're doing *T*-4 *T*-3 .
WSJ_1562.MRG-21   Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled *-1 at whatever price the broker can get *T*-2 .
WSJ_1564.MRG-22   They estimate the return 0 a person 's current portfolio is likely *-3 to generate *T*-2 over time , along with a standard deviation that *T*-1 suggests how much the return will vary *T*-4 year by year .
WSJ_1564.MRG-32   -LRB- Here 's *T*-1 how * to interpret a standard deviation figure *T*-2 : * Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it .
WSJ_1566.MRG-6   You know who you are *T*-1 .
WSJ_1566.MRG-13   Likewise , mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what *T*-1 was , for me , a serious investment .
WSJ_1566.MRG-24   Your priorities may be different , but here in Figure 2 is *T*-1 where I 've chosen *-2 to build for the future *T*-3 : personal space ; automotive pursuits ; children 's toys ; gardening equipment , bulbs and shrubs ; and finally , entertainment , perhaps the best investment of all .
WSJ_1567.MRG-9   There is no effective regulation of planners , no accepted standard for admission into their ranks -- a dog got into one trade group -- no way 0 * to assess their performance *T*-1 , no way even 0 * to know how many of them there are *T*-2 -LRB- estimates range from 60,000 to 450,000 -RRB- .
WSJ_1567.MRG-11   So it *EXP*-2 should come as no shock that the profession , if that 's what it is *T*-3 , has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents *T*-1 seem *-4 to be * frittering away *RNR*-5 or flat-out stealing *RNR*-5 their clients ' money .
WSJ_1567.MRG-18   What *T*-1 's more , the losses 0 they and the others caused *T*-3 `` are just what we are stumbling over *T*-2 , '' says 0 *T*-5 Mr. Stapf , *-4 adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go *-6 undetected .
WSJ_1567.MRG-28   But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners -LRB- IAFP -RRB- , the industry 's biggest trade group , is still nearly triple what it was *T*-2 in 1980 , and it *EXP*-3 's believed that the ranks of planners who *T*-1 do n't belong to any group have soared as well .
WSJ_1567.MRG-44   That may be because Mr. Gargan , *-1 smarting at what he considered *T*-2 slurs on his membership standards made * by the rival group , enrolled his dog , Beauregard , as a member of the IAFP .
WSJ_1568.MRG-24   The median price of homes is $ 547,000 *U* ; more than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls *T*-1 the nation 's largest pleasure-boat harbor .
WSJ_1568.MRG-26   `` That 's what they 're after *T*-1 . ''
WSJ_1569.MRG-30   Their message , explicit or implicit , is that a good college will cost so much *ICH*-2 by whenever you want it *T*-1 that the tried and true wo n't do anymore .
WSJ_1569.MRG-50   Parents , he says 0 *T*-1 , should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford *T*-2 .
WSJ_1570.MRG-31   And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers , the IRS wants *-4 to see which dependents *T*-2 show up on more than one return -- and which dependents *T*-3 turn out *-5 to be deceased .
WSJ_1572.MRG-5   But what we may not know *T*-2 is just what *T*-1 makes somebody a sucker .
WSJ_1572.MRG-12   `` These people are very skilled at * finding out what *T*-1 makes a person tick , '' says *T*-2 Kent Neal , chief of the economic-crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , a major haven for boiler rooms .
WSJ_1572.MRG-13   `` Once they size them up , then they know what buttons * to push *T*-1 . ''
WSJ_1572.MRG-73   Nick Cortese thinks 0 that 's what *T*-1 happened to him .
WSJ_1574.MRG-45   So * view permanent insurance for what it is *T*-1 -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .
WSJ_1582.MRG-25   The problem , says 0 *T*-1 Mr. D'Arcy , a psychologist , is that `` it *EXP*-2 's very hard * to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance *T*-3 .
WSJ_1583.MRG-4   In recent years , carriers have become much more picky about who *T*-1 can fly on the cheap .
WSJ_1586.MRG-7   The difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years *T*-1 .
WSJ_1586.MRG-9   `` The small , good fur salon is not what it used *-2 to be *T*-1 , '' says *T*-3 Mr. Purnick , 75 years old .
WSJ_1586.MRG-60   But Mr. Rosen responds : `` Whatever people want *-1 to buy *T*-2 , I 'll sell *T*-3 .
WSJ_1591.MRG-6   `` What this means *T*-1 is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do *?* , '' the spokesman said *T*-2 .
WSJ_1599.MRG-18   `` This is a good move , but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are *T*-1 , '' in terms of earnings growth , said Joel D. Gross , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .
WSJ_1599.MRG-21   But the company said 0 the amount ca n't be determined *-1 until it knows how many managers *T*-2 opt *-3 to retire .
WSJ_1615.MRG-43   He hurt himself further this summer by *-1 bringing homosexual issues into the debate ; and by *-2 wavering on this issue and abortion , he has weakened his credibility in what *T*-3 is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides .
WSJ_1616.MRG-10   `` It has been in what I would describe *T*-1 as a lull for the past several months . ''
WSJ_1622.MRG-7   And liquidity is what markets need *T*-1 *-2 to damp quakes and aftershocks .
WSJ_1622.MRG-21   What market makers provide *T*-1 is immediacy , a very valuable service .
WSJ_1622.MRG-24   Market makers buy what investors wish *-2 to sell *T*-1 ; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors , and at a profit .
WSJ_1623.MRG-53   That 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid *T*-1 .
WSJ_1624.MRG-35   The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans .
WSJ_1625.MRG-6   But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited *-1 by an organized charity *-4 to help fight cancer , famine , child abuse , or what have *T*-2 you *T*-3 .
WSJ_1625.MRG-54   What it does n't say *T*-1 is that the entire `` campaign '' may be the fund-raising letter itself .
WSJ_1629.MRG-21   `` Much of what we set out *-2 to do *T*-1 is completed *-3 . ''
WSJ_1631.MRG-46   Finally , even the time-honored strategy called * `` value investing '' no longer means what it once did *?* *T*-1 .
WSJ_1634.MRG-107   But it paled by comparison to what Sony was *-1 to offer last month : the chance , at last , * to run a major studio , about $ 50 million *U* in deferred compensation , up to 10 % of Columbia 's future cash flow , 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value , and annual salaries of $ 2.7 million *U* for each .
WSJ_1635.MRG-43   But for individuals who *T*-1 buy much smaller amounts and care less *ICH*-2 about relative performance than in * preserving what they have *T*-3 , that margin is meaningless .
WSJ_1635.MRG-87   And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. , of what he calls *T*-1 `` DeVoe 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1 :
WSJ_1643.MRG-2   From my orange seat , I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what *T*-1 was *-2 to have been the third game of the World Series .
WSJ_1643.MRG-24   Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what *T*-1 was going on .
WSJ_1647.MRG-12   As part of the same bill , the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations , in what committee member Sen. David Pryor -LRB- D. , Ark . -RRB- calls *T*-1 a `` feeding frenzy '' of special-interest legislating .
WSJ_1654.MRG-37   `` What you 'll hear *T*-1 as we get into December is that sales are sluggish , '' predicts *T*-2 Woolworth 's Mr. Sells .
WSJ_1655.MRG-27   What *T*-1 's so discouraging is ... ''
WSJ_1657.MRG-42   *-3 Questioned *-2 in Washington about what *T*-1 would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail , President Arias voiced expectations of direct U.S. action .
WSJ_1666.MRG-3   Pitney Bowes acquired the core of what *T*-1 evolved into Wheeler Group in 1979 by *-2 buying Dictaphone Corp .
WSJ_1671.MRG-27   They 're frightened by what they see *T*-1 in New Jersey , and especially Virginia , where pro-life GOP candidates for governor are being pummeled *-3 on abortion *T*-2 .
WSJ_1671.MRG-35   The Republican danger is 0 that abortion could become for them what it 's long been *T*-1 for Democrats , a divisive litmus test .
WSJ_1677.MRG-3   Now they plan *-2 to sell us products that *T*-1 sift through all the information *-3 to give us what we really want *-5 to know *T*-4 .
WSJ_1677.MRG-5   `` Filtered news is what people want *T*-2 , '' says *T*-3 Esther Dyson , editor of Release 1.0 , an industry newsletter that *T*-1 spots new developments .
WSJ_1677.MRG-6   `` Most people read 10 times more than necessary in order *-1 to find out what they really need *T*-2 . ''
WSJ_1677.MRG-46   `` All these interconnected computers make it *EXP*-4 difficult * to sort out what *T*-1 's junk and what *T*-2 's important , '' says *T*-5 Chuck Digate , a former Lotus Development executive who *T*-3 has started a new company 0 *T*-6 to cope with the problem .
WSJ_1678.MRG-8   That award ended a dispute between Dean Witter and Mr. Bachman over who *T*-1 was responsible for certain bond-trading losses around the time of the 1987 stock-market crash .
WSJ_1688.MRG-15   From what he saw *T*-2 on television , Mr. Chesley points out that Interstate 880 , which *T*-1 collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters , suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared *-3 to sustain no damage whatsoever .
